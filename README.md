## FXFEL Project Documentation
#Welcome to FXFEL Project Documentation.
The FXFEL project consists of small number of handshaking Pythons scripts are a set of routines that alter the format of data in well-defined ways, without changing the information content. These routines are included in the UKFEL suite for two separate reasons:
* The suite contains simulator programs from various sources. ASTRA [2], ELEGANT [3] and VISIT [4] were developed externally. MASP and PUFFIN were developed ‘in-house’ by the UKFEL team. In general, these programs all use different, non-standard data formats for their input and output, and it would not be appropriate for us to modify them to conform to a common format. Some of the hand-shaking routines do the conversions needed to connect the output of one program (say ASTRA) to the input of another, such as MASP.
* All graphics and visualisations generated by the UKFEL suite are displayed by VISIT, a general-purpose graphics program. To obtain suitable displays, the data supplied to VISIT from the other modules must be conditioned in various ways, depending on the type of display needed. For example, certain types of display may need averages or cumulative totals, and these can be provided by routines that do the calculation and modify the data accordingly, before it is supplied to VISIT. The UKFEL suite includes a library of conditioning routines which will serve for most purposes. We also supply instructions and examples to show how to write new routines, using PYTHON. We have adopted HDF5 as a ‘base’ format. When representing an electron beam, each record represents for a macro-particle, which is a group of electrons with identical properties. The properties are:
* Position in three orthogonal space coordinates X, Y and Z. The principal direction of motion is in the Z axis.
*Momentum in the three directions : P x, P y and P z. Electrons are usually travelling at near-light speeds, and the momenta take account of the consequent increase in mass.
* The number of electrons in the particle.
The values of length are in SI units (meters) but momentum is in scaled units (divided over
(m · c)).
